Python script for managing subscribers of mlmmj lists

Right now it can subscribe, unsubscribe and list subscribers.
Maybe later it will be able to create/delete lists, do some actions with message archives, execute more than one command per email, etc...

How to use it:

1) Add alias to your mail server, like that:
   mlmmj: "|/path/to/script/mlmmj-management.py"

2) Edit script options at beginning of file. You surely need to edit AUTHORIZED_SENDERS and PASS options. Others may be ok for you. And may be not.

3) Now you can send email to your alias, with some commands in message body. Example:

"sub; secret_list; john@email.com"  -  subscribe john@email.com to 'secret_list' list
"unsub; other_list; other_john@other_email.com" - unsubscribe other_john@other_email.com from 'other_list' list
"list; third_list" - list subscribers of 'third_list'

Thats all.
